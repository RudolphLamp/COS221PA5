## Project Description

For our COS221 module, we were tasked with creating a large database and developing a web application to manage and update it. 
The project involved designing a streaming service from the ground up, featuring both admin and normal user functionalities. 
Admin users have the ability to manage content and user data, while normal users can interact with the streaming service to access and enjoy the content.

## Installation
